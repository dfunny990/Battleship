COBB Tuning Programming test
Battleship Readme


Battleship represented in a text-based console. In Windows 7, the executable runs, and it works pretty well.
It works as a normal Battleship game should, with options for number of players (0-2).
With 0 players, the computer plays itself.
With 1 player, the person plays against the computer.
With 2 players, two people play against each other in a pass and play fashion.
The board layout is the traditional 10x10 layout, with letters across the top and numbers along the side.
Coordinates are given in a letter first then number combination.
While coordinates are asked for on separate lines, they may be given in a single string, i.e. "A2"
Coordinates are not case sensative. "a7" is equivalent to "A7"
In order to make the game more interesting, the AI's ship placement is random, seeded with the time.


Possible upgrades:
I considered upgrading the AI so it did more than just randomly guess, and actually based guesses on history of guesses.
The phone app has a mode that gives you as many shots per turn as you have ships alive.
I thought these would be interesting additions and hopefully wrote this program so that it could be upgraded accordingly.
Function consolidation. There are multiple places where a single function could be placed multiple places to save on code.

Time Consumption:
About 1 hour of planning with literally pencil and paper
About 5.5-6 hours of actual coding. I made some mistakes in planning and tried to make it more complicated than it needed to be.
I also hadn't realized that I did need to keep track of an entire board for each player. (it was a really weird morning)
About 1-1.5 hours of pure testing, commenting, tidying, and realizing where I could consolidate functions.

All in all, it took a little longer than the 8 hours anticipated, but it felt good to be solving these problems again.
I look forward to your thoughts on this program and hearing from you in general.

Thanks,
